Spiced Academy: Social Network Project

The goal of this project was to study React, Socket.io and Redux while creating a social network with features like
friend request, bio editor, picture upload, chat, online users, search etc. 
This social network has just a learning and demo purpose. I chose the topic of foodsharing randomly as
as work in progress topic.
